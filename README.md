# Personal Portfolio
I've created a website to display my portfolio as a front end developer. 

The ultimate objective of this website is to acquire front end development jobs, either from a prospective employer or someone looking to hire a freelancer. This is achieved by giving the user sufficient information to understand my skillset and assess if I'm qualified to carry out the work required.

Users can read about my skillset and experience whilst also browsing previous projects I've worked on. I've made it possible to contact me by adding a contact form and clearly signposting to this form at various points throughout the website.

## UX
There are two main users this website is designed for, employers looking to hire full time or for freelance work. 

## Features

All pages
- Navigation: I've created two styles, one for desktop and mobile. 
    - Desktop: The nav bar constantly displays each page with the active page highlighted so that the user can easily see the site structure and where they are on the website.
    - Mobile: The nav bar collapses to a burger nav for smaller devices. This is to maintain a clean and simplified layout on devices with a limited screensize.
